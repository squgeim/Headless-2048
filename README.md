# Headless-2048
As an off-branch of 2048-Deep-Learning, I am creating this Node.js based headless 2048, which can more easily be used with an AI.

Forking off of the 2048 repository, I added a deep learning neural network to attempt to train it to play 2048. Some limitations were found. Not the least of which was the fact that I was tied directly to the browser, given 2048 was tied to the browser.

Enter Headless 2048. With this Headless version of 2048, I am able to run the game without a display interface, or with, but contained inside of Node.js, running on a server, which I can setup with much better performance than your typical browser.

I can also set up multiple games running at once, using different variations, and any number of other things.
